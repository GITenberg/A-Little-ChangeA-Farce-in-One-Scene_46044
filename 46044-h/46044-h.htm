<p class="scene">S<span class="smallerfont">CENE</span>.—<i>A Room in a Hotel, with
windows in the flat, opening upon a balcony, and overlooking the sea; doors <span
class="stage">R.</span> and <span class="stage">L.</span></i></p>

<p class="entrance">E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>,<i> with a newspaper, yawning
and stretching, </i>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span><i> gazing at him.</i></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Edwin!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Yes, my dear. (<i>yawns</i>)</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Edwin!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. What’s the matter?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. That’s the fifteenth time you’ve yawned since
we’ve been married.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Do you say so? Only fifteen yawns, and we’ve
been married——</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Ten days, three and twenty hours, and sixteen
minutes. Does it seem that long?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. My darling, seem that long! How can you ask
such questions? I should think it doesn’t. I declare, it only seems about three weeks!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Three weeks!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. No, no! Did I say three weeks? I beg your
pardon, I meant days.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I don’t believe you did!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. O yes, my dear, indeed I meant to say days.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. You’re not tired of me already, are you?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. My dear Ethel, that’s the twenty-second time
you’ve asked me whether I’m not tired of you.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Well, you’re not, are you?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I’m not tired of you, my darling, but I’m
getting very tired of saying so, and I’m most tired of all of this confounded
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, Edwin, it’s the most delightful place I
ever saw! Why, everybody says the scenery about here is the very scenery to pass
through.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I am quite of their opinion. It is certainly
not scenery to stop in.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And the chambermaid was telling me this morning
how delighted everybody was who went away.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I can completely sympathise with them; I’m sure
I shall be charmed when <i>I</i> go.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Why, what would you have? There are the
loveliest sunsets.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Now, that’s just what I object to. I don’t like
the suns about here; these blazing agricultural suns make such a fuss about retiring for
the night. They’re not content unless they’ve everybody looking at ’em. Now, a respectable
manufacturing sun gets behind a good thick cloud when it goes to bed; and I must say I
think that’s much more reputable.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Then the moons. You must confess the moons here
are the loveliest imaginable.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Then, that stupid old moon. Now, can anything
be more absurd than standing on a balcony and staring at the same old moon night after
night?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Edwin, how can you talk about the same old
moon, when there’s a new one every month?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. A pretty swindle that is, too! A new one every
month. That’s just as like the one that went before it, as the one that’ll come after it.
I like a little change.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. You didn’t cut the moon up that way once. You
used to look at it for hours. You were quite smitten with it then.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I freely grant that if I stood and gazed at it
for hours, I must have been considerably struck by it.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, Edwin dear, don’t you remember that night
in particular——</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Do I remember that night? Oh, Ethel, shall I
ever forget that night—that night when—by the by, my dear, which night were you alluding
to?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I said that one in particular.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Precisely so, my love, but then there were
so<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span> many ones in
particular, and all are so indelibly impressed upon my memory, I can’t remember one of
them.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I can remember all of them. Your saying that
you’d rather have me than all the world.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Did I say that?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Twice over: for I asked you if you were quite
sure.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. And I replied——</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. As sure as you were you.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Then I don’t think the observation goes for
much; since, if I made so foolish a remark, I certainly was not myself.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Then wouldn’t you give all the world for
me?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I should be very silly if I did, for if I had
the world to give, I should have you to start with. See?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. (<i>with reluctance</i>) Yes.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. You quite see?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Yes—but you would give all the world for me,
for all that, wouldn’t you? At least you’d rather have me than any other two people put
together?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Certainly, my dear. I don’t much care for
freaks of nature of that sort.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And you’ve got me, haven’t you?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Yes, and you’ve got me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And you’re very happy, aren’t you?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Oh yes.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. You’re in Paradise?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Exactly so.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And so am I.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Do you like it?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Well, of course I do. Don’t you?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Oh yes! I like it very much; but then, you know
I like a little change. I think a little Paradise is very nice indeed, but don’t you think
that one may have more Paradise than’s good for one? I can’t help thinking it’s a great
mistake to take one’s Paradise neat. Now we’ve been taking ours uncommon neat. Just think,
the hours we’ve been cooped up in that confounded private room upstairs.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Well, Edwin dear, you said you could not<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span> stand us being the only
people there, so we’ve come down into the public room.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. And now we <i>have</i> come, we’re the only
people here. I never knew such a disgusting place. Now, if we’d had a little change——</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. You might have met that odious Miss Carruthers,
I suppose you mean—the girl that threw you over.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Miss Carruthers is not odious, my dear, and
Miss Carruthers didn’t throw me over. Miss Carruthers was uncommonly fond of me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Why didn’t she have you, then?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Because she didn’t get the chance. My only
apprehension is lest I threw Miss Carruthers over.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. If you did, she must have tumbled on her nose,
for I am sure it’s broken.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. No, my dear, it’s you who are responsible for
anything that there may be to do with Miss Carruthers’ nose, for it was you who put it
out. But nothing is the matter with it. It’s a lovely nose—especially the end of it.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Her eyes appear to think so, for they’re always
looking there. But that may be, because it is the only object they can look at both
together.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. You don’t mean to say she squints!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Abominably.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I never saw such eyes!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Well, well, whatever they may be, she hasn’t
made them.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But she has, repeatedly—at you. And that’s what
I object to. If folks do squint, they can’t help it, but if folks who squint go on as if
they didn’t squint, why they deserve to have their eyes flung in their teeth.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Now, why bring teeth into the question? What
have Miss Carruthers’ teeth done that they should be flung at?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. What they’ve done I’m sure I don’t know, but I
should imagine a good deal. They look as if they’d seen hard service.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. You compare them to a regiment of soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Excuse me: to a regiment of volunteers: I
should never have dreamt of comparing them to anything regular.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Oh, nonsense, they’re a string of pearls.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Yes, pearls that have gone yellow.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Anyhow, you must admit, she has a very amiable
mouth.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I don’t think that her mouth is amiable at all,
or it would cover up her teeth more.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Well, what feature are you going to enlarge on
next? Her ears?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I’m sure her ears don’t want enlarging on;
they’re big enough already.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Now there’s only her hair left. Abuse her
hair.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, no, my love, she’s not responsible for
that. It’s not her own.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. If she were only here now!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But she’s not; and what’s more you’re not going
to where she is.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I don’t care where I go, so long as I leave
this place.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But you won’t leave this place. We stop here a
month.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Ethel!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. A month.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. A week!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. A month.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. A fortnight!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. A month.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. There’s not a soul here.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Well, what of it? You’re a married man.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Alas!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And you’ve no business carrying on with Miss
Carruthers, and Miss Carruthers has no business carrying on with you.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. But she doesn’t know I’m married. Ha, ha,
ha!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. She must have seen it in the papers.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. But I didn’t put it in the papers.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. You don’t mean to say you haven’t put our
marriage in the papers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Not in one of them, my dear. I daren’t. That
girl had so made up her mind that I was going to propose to her, that the announcement of
our marriage would have given her fits.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And so it isn’t in the papers! Oh! it isn’t
half being married, when it isn’t in the papers! We stop here for two months.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. We leave here to-morrow. (<i>at the window</i>)
Ethel! Ethel! I distinctly see a woman. Positively—yes, a woman has arrived. She turns
this way. She looks—she smiles—she bows. By jingo, Miss Carruthers! Ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. No! (<i>runs to window</i>) It <i>is</i> her!
We leave here to-morrow.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. (<i>sitting down firmly</i>) We stop here for
two months.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh! (<i>jumps up to window</i>) Well, I
declare. Well, did I ever? This is charming. (<i>to some one without</i>) How d’ you do?
How are you? Quite well, thank you; so glad that you’ve come. Oh, Edwin, if there’s not
that dear delightful Captain Plunger.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Eh?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. You know. That darling Captain Plunger.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. You don’t mean that—that infernal fellow with
the whiskers, whom I’ve been so nearly kicking several times.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. That very man. My favourite admirer.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Ethel, you’re a married woman.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But he doesn’t know it, dear. He can’t.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Because it wasn’t in the paper, love. Ha, ha,
ha, ha! Ta, ta. I’m going to put another dress on, and some more hair, and to go on just
as if I wasn’t married, dear. He doesn’t know I am, because it wasn’t in the papers. Ha,
ha, ha, ha! Not in one of them! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p class="direction_2 italics">Exit, <span class="stage">R</span>.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I’ve made a horrible mistake. I ought to have
pretended that it <i>was</i> put in the papers, every one of them, except the ones that
can be got at Dumpington. A pretty mess my candour’s got me into. This is the consequence
of telling one’s wife the truth. But who’d<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span> have thought that fellow with the whiskers would turn up? I
did think that at last I’d given him the slip. He dogs me everywhere. I never could get
half a dozen words with either Ethel or that Miss Carruthers, but he put his whiskers in
between us, and it was all up with me. What chance has intellect with whiskers? I shall
have to give the local barber half a sovereign to clip one off by accident. Meanwhile, the
first thing I must do, must be to let him know that Ethel’s married. Oh, no, hang it, the
first thing he’d do, would be to tell the tale to Miss Carruthers. I must be a bachelor
again; there’s no help for it. It’ll at any rate be a relief to the monotony of
Dumpington. On even terms I’d fight it out with pleasure, but I’m overweighted. Nature is
<i>not</i> fair. She doesn’t divide the whiskers properly.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P<span
class="smallerfont">LUNGER</span>, <span class="stage">R</span>.,<i> advancing quickly to
him.</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh, Mr. Larkspur, how d’you do? You can’t
think how rejoiced I was to see you at the window just now; Dumpington is so extremely
dull without society.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. It is indeed. I’m sure I was entranced when I
saw you. I was quite longing for a little change.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Have you been here some time?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Ten days—and I have seen about as many people.
(<i>they sit</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I suppose it’s not the season just now.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I supposed so, too, until my first week’s bill
came in, when I discovered that the season was exactly at its height—at least, the charges
were at theirs.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. What in the world induced you to come
here?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I wasn’t induced to come here. I was
brought.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Indeed. Who brought you?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Mrs. Larkspur.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Mrs. Larkspur!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. (<i>aside</i>) Oh dear me, what <i>have</i> I
said? Yes, I was brought here by—my mother.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh, your mother. Then, your mother’s here?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Yes, she was recommended the sea air.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. She’s not well?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. No, she’s not very well. In fact she’s so ill
that she has to keep her room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh dear, I’m sorry to hear that. I fear, then,
I shan’t see her.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I’m afraid you won’t—(<i>aside</i>) considering
she’s been dead this twenty years.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. But you’re not quite alone here, I perceive. I
met Miss Darlington upon the stairs.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Yes, she is staying here.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Upon the look out for a husband, I suppose.
How very plain she’s grown!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Plain?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Don’t you think so?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Well, perhaps she isn’t quite so pretty as she
used to be.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Pretty? She never was that. She once had a
passable figure.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. An exquisite figure.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Do you think so? What extraordinary taste you
men have! Anyhow, she’s gone off.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. (<i>jumping up</i>) Gone off! What, with
Captain Plunger?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Ha, ha, ha! You didn’t think he’d run away
with her? I meant, gone off in looks.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Oh. (<i>drops again into a chair</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. By the way, the captain <i>is</i> here: came
by the same train as we did: and we all know how she’s angled for him.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I don’t though, I’m sure.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. You don’t know how Miss Darlington has angled
after Captain Plunger? Why, where ever have you been this five years? It’s the talk of the
whole regiment. So that there was some reason for your exclamation, though not much; for
any one at all acquainted with the parties would be quite sure Captain Plunger wouldn’t
run away with Ethel Darlington.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh! Captain Plunger is a man of taste. He
couldn’t possibly put up with any girl of that sort.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. What sort?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Why, the sort of girl who is so very
indiscriminate in the attention she receives. He has too great a scorn for such a
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. And yet I think at the Artillery Ball I saw him
putting up with Ethel Darlington to the extent of half-a-dozen dances in succession. He
contrives to hide his scorn uncommonly.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. He would do. Captain Plunger is a perfect
gentleman. He’d flirt with her, no doubt.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I’ve seen him.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. He might even get engaged to her.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Indeed!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. But he would never marry such a girl.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Although he’d get engaged to her?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh dear, no! Captain Plunger is a man of fine
morality.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I always thought he was that sort of man.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. The more one sees of him, the more one likes
him. (<i>rising</i>)</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Really! Then, seeing him must have the opposite
effect to hearing of him, for the more I hear of him the more I feel inclined to kick him.
(<i>rising</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. You don’t like him?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I detest him!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh, you jealous man! You’re envious of his
success amongst the ladies.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I should like to cut his whiskers off.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. And so shear Samson of his strength.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. However, I won’t vent my malice upon you; I
must point out the beauties of the neighbourhood. It won’t take long.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. We’d better go outside to see them, hadn’t
we?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I think you’ll see enough of them from where
you stand. Now, are you looking?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Yes.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Up there’s the sky.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Well, I’ve seen that before.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Oh, if you think that you’ll see anything in
Dumpington you haven’t seen before, why, you’ll be disappointed.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Well, what next?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Down there’s the sand.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Yes, don’t they call it something else? Not
sand, but something like it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Strand?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Strand! that’s it.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Yes, some people call it strand. The grocers
call it sugar.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. How very playful of them! Well, go on, and
tell me the next beauty.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Over there’s the sun.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. But I can’t look at that, because of my
complexion.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Oh! I’m sorry you can’t look at that, because
it’s the last beauty of Dumpington.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Is that all?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. That’s all.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Good gracious, how do people pass their time
here?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. In the morning, they sit and look at the sun.
In the evening, they sit and look at the moon. Oh dear, I quite forgot—occasionally you
can see the sea.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. The sea!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Sometimes—through a strong telescope.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. You goose, it’s there.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Why so it is, the tide has actually arrived.
For the first time in the ten days that I have been at Dumpington the tide is coming in.
It’s always been going out before. Hush! Hark!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. What to?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. The music of the spheres. (<i>a German
band strikes up outside</i>)</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OTH</span>. Oh law!</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. This is the public room, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, good gracious, do send some one out to stop
that very brassy band. (<i>it stops</i>)</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. The band, sir? Oh, that’s nothing. You should
hear the Christy Minstrels—them as never play in London, sir—the two men with the harp and
fiddle, the blind man with the accordion, the woman with the tambourine, the lad with the
tin whistle, the three foreign girls with the two banjoes and a drum, the Punch and
Judy<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span> Show, the
bagpipes, and the barrel-organs With the monkeys, all agoing at once. It makes it very
lively, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Yes, deadly lively.</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Dumpington is very musical.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Then, Dumpington is very different from its
musicians.</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. It’s the children what they play to, sir.
We’ve a large family on the ground floor just recovering from the measles, a small family
on the floor above as have just had the whooping cough—oh, in the night, sir, they whoops
awful—and a middling family in the next room what’s just halfway through the scarlet
fever; and a very nice attack they’re having.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Heaven preserve us! then is Dumpington a
hospital?</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. A hospital? I don’t know about that, sir. The
Montpelier of the North, they calls it.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Who does?</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Well, the railway companies.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. How d’ you get down to the sea?</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. You go along the pier, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, you walk along the pier.</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Not many people walk, sir—it’s a mile long.
Trains start every fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. That’s if anybody wants to go?</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Precisely so, sir; but as no one ever does
want, they don’t start at all, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. What the dickens do the people do then?</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Well, they’re mostly wheeled about in Bath
chairs.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, preserve us! Where is Mrs. Plunger?</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Went out on the balcony as we came in,
sir—with a gentleman.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. A gentleman! Did she seem to know him?</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Very much, sir.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. You can go. I’ll join them.</p>

<p>W<span class="smallerfont">AITER</span>. Beg your pardon, sir, but I don’t think they

<p class="no_indent">Upon my word, my wife has lost no time in finding a companion. I
don’t think that I can pay her a more<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span> fitting compliment than that of following her example.
It’s a lucky thing for Dumpington I saw Miss Darlington just now, or I’d have gone by the
first train that starts for anywhere. I wonder if she knows I’m married? Let us hope the
London papers don’t reach here. (<i>sees paper</i>) What’s this? The “Dumpington Gazette.”
It’s not in that. (<i>sits down and reads</i>) “Salubrity of Dumpington. The slanderous
assertion that this fashionable watering place, the annual rendezvous of such a galaxy of
rank and beauty, is infected with an epidemic, is the baseless calumny of venomous
malignity. The only fifteen cases in the neighbourhood are yielding rapidly to the
invigorating influence of our sea air, and the unflagging energy and skill of Dr. Mumps,
the able and experienced practitioner, who advertises weekly in the ‘Dumpington
Gazette.’”</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Meanwhile </i>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span><i> has
re-entered,</i> <span class="stage">R</span>., <i>and sat beside him.</i></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Do you find the paper very interesting?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. (<i>jumping up</i>) Miss Darlington! I beg ten
thousand pardons for not seeing you before. This is indeed a happy meeting. I was reading
in the paper that a galaxy of rank and beauty was at Dumpington, and I was wondering where
the beauty was, unconscious that it was so near me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Very near indeed, for Miss Carruthers is at
this hotel.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I beg your pardon, who is?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Miss Carruthers.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. What, is Miss Carruthers Miss Carruthers
still?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, dear me, yes.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) Hurrah! She doesn’t know I’m
married. “Sound the loud timbrel o’er Egypt’s——” (<i>a tambourine strikes up outside</i>)
Oh, dear!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. There’s that eternal woman with the tambourine;
do send her away, please!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. (<i>runs to window</i>) There, that’ll do; we’ve
got no coppers. (<i>coming back</i>) You were saying——</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I was saying that Miss Carruthers is still Miss
Carruthers, and is likely to remain so. That is, if men really have the taste that they
pretend to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Do you really think so? Oh, I don’t know, she’s
a dashing girl.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I don’t like dashing girls.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Well, when I say a dashing girl, I mean she’s
undeniably accomplished.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I have heard she paints!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Ah, you don’t care for her. Well, I admit, she
is a little difficult to understand.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, dear me, no! I call her very plain.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. And yet she is considered beautiful by some.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I only know one person who considers so, and
that’s herself.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, but I know another.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Do you? What’s the curious creature’s name?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. His name——</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. <i>His</i> name. I thought it was a man. Well,
what’s his name?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. His name is Larkspur.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Larkspur!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Larkspur.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. It’s my turn to beg your pardon now. You’re
very much mistaken. Mr. Larkspur doesn’t care for her at all.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Indeed; I wonder what possessed him to propose
to her.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Propose to her!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Yes, don’t you know that he’s proposed to
her?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I don’t believe it—not a word of it!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I have it on the very best authority.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. On whose?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. On Miss Carruthers’ own.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh! Miss Carruthers’ own! ha, ha, ha! Captain
Plunger, now I should have thought with your experience of the world you would have known
that upon such a subject Miss Carruthers’ was the very worst authority you could possibly
have.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I’m sure she hinted that he had proposed to
her.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. That I can quite believe. But she is labouring
under a mistake. The wish was husband to the thought.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I think the probabilities are in her favour. Mr.
Larkspur is the sort of man who would propose to<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span> her, and it would only be one more rejection added to the
quantity he has already suffered.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. What, has Mr. Larkspur then proposed to someone
else?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. They say, he never sees a girl three times
without proposing to her.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And he’s always unsuccessful?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Well, I did hear a vague rumour that some girl
or other had at last had pity on him,—but by Jove, she must have been hard up.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Indeed! He must have been astonished at his
sudden change of fortune.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Quite knocked over. So I heard. He’d got so used
to being rejected, that he felt quite disappointed when he was accepted. And between us
two——</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I shouldn’t like his wife to hear it—but between
us two, he told a friend of mine that if he’d thought she’d have accepted him, he’d never
have proposed to her.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Did he? How very amusing!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, extremely entertaining. It’d be a very good
joke to tell his wife.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I wouldn’t do that. It is a very good joke, but
perhaps she mightn’t see it.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Perhaps not: wives are very dull. But he’s a rum
fish. Everybody cuts his joke at him. Indeed, he’s got so laughed at that he’s started for
Australia.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Do you say so?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. At Southampton now.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. He’s at Southampton?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. So my friend says.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I’m afraid your friend is not to be implicitly
relied upon, for Mr. Larkspur happens to be here.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. In Dumpington?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. At this hotel.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Then, that’s the man who’s flirting with my—that
is, Miss Carruthers.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Where?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Upon the balcony.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Is Mr. Larkspur on the balcony with Miss
Carruthers? (<i>runs to window</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I have reason to believe so.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. So he is. Oh, very well. (<i>returns</i>) Shall
<i>we</i> go out upon the balcony?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. The waiter said he thought they didn’t want to
be interrupted.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Don’t they? That’s the very reason, then, why
we should interrupt them. Would you kindly let me take your arm?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. With pleasure.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Won’t it be delightful?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, enchanting! To recline against the
balustrade, and listen to the sighing of the sad sea waves. (<i>barrel organ starts
outside</i>)</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, there’s that dreadful barrel organ. Please
do stop it.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. (<i>runs to window</i>) There, there, my good
fellow. He won’t stop. My good man, please—It’s no go. Stop that row, you noisy vagabond!
He <i>won’t</i> stop.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, I’d give him something. He won’t go unless
you do.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. You’ll give him something, did you say?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I said, I would, if I were you.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, just so. Look here, you! I’ll give
you—(<i>organ stops</i>)—into custody! (<i>organ begins again</i>) How much? He
says it’s sixpence if he plays and eighteen-pence to go away.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Well, give him eighteen-pence.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. You’ll give him eighteen-pence?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. He would not care for me. You’d better give it
him.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Oh, certainly. (<i>pulls money out</i>) Dear me,
I haven’t got a sixpence.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Haven’t you? I daresay he wouldn’t mind two
shillings.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) This is deucedly expensive.
(<i>throws a coin</i>) There, you scoundrel! (<i>organ stops</i>) And now, might I have
the pleasure? (<i>offering arm</i>)</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. (<i>taking it</i>) Would you take my fan?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I shall be charmed. These English beggars have
such barbarous instruments. (<i>the bagpipes start</i>).</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. There that’s the Scotchman. He’s the worst
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18">[Pg 18]</a></span> of all. Pray do
get rid of him. The bagpipes always make we ill.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. (<i>again at window</i>) My dear good fellow—you
infernal rascal, stop that hideous din!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, send him off—do send him off. I’m going to
be so ill.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Hi! How much will you go away for? What? He says
he never goes away for less than half-a-crown.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. He doesn’t. The bagpipes never do. They know
that they can get the money. Give it him.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. (<i>aside</i>) I shall be ruined. (<i>throws
another coin</i>) There! Be off! (<i>they cease</i>) Now, shall we go?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Would you relieve me of my shawl?</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Delighted, I am sure. (<i>they move slowly
towards the window, <span class="stage">R</span>., arm in arm, he bowing down to her, she
smiling up at him</i>)</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Re-enter </i>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span><i> through

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I’m getting on tremendously with Miss
Carruthers. This is great fun; I do like a little change. Now, if Ethel wasn’t so absurdly
fond of me—if she would only flirt a bit—(<i>perceiving her</i>) Holloa! It strikes me she
is flirting a bit. (B<span class="smallerfont">OY</span> <i>outside has just commenced to
sing</i>)</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh, really, Captain Plunger!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">OY</span>. (<i>singing</i>) “And the captain with his
whiskers stole a sly glance at me.”</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Oh, come, I say, you know. It strikes me
Ethel’s flirting a good deal. It seems <i>she</i> likes a little change. This isn’t such
great fun after all.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I hope that no one will disturb us.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. I’d advise them not.</p>

<p class="direction_2 italics">Exeunt through <span class="stage">R</span>. window.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. (<i>who has come round gradually, <span

<p class="direction_2 italics">Exit through same window.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Re-enter </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P<span
class="smallerfont">LUNGER</span><i> through <span class="stage">L</span>. window.</i></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Where’s Mr. Larkspur got to I should like to
know? I’m not going to be left in this way, I can tell him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Re-enter </i>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>,<i> through
<span class="stage">L</span>. window.</i></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. There they both are. Won’t there be a row?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. My dearest Ethel!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Oh my darling Alice! (<i>they embrace</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I’ve been having such fun.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. So have I.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I’m in the middle of a desperate
flirtation.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. That’s exactly what I’m coming to myself.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Ah, but my dear, you don’t know what
flirtation is. Wait till you’re married. Then’s the time.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But <i>you’re</i> not married?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I’m not married! Why, my dear, where have you
been this age? I made sure everybody knew that I was married this day week.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I’ve no doubt you endeavoured to let everybody
know, my love; but being away upon my honeymoon, I didn’t hear of it.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. What are <i>you</i> married too?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Good gracious! You didn’t know that I was
married ten days ago! Where have you been this century?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Then, we’ve both of us got husbands.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But I got mine first.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Perhaps so. You were always in a hurry to get
married.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Was I, love? Then I’d a fault which you had
not, for everyone says you’ve been long enough about it.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. It’s quite true I didn’t snap at the first
offer that was made to me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. You didn’t snap at it, indeed; you were
uncommon civil to it. So polite, in fact, that you accepted it.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. The offer that my husband made to me was not
the first by any means.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Then it’s true, is it? I had heard that he’d
proposed to several other girls before.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. How could you, when you hadn’t heard I was
married?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But I had heard you were going to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Then, why were you astonished when you found I
was?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Because, my love, I had dismissed the rumour as
incredible.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. And who did rumour say had got possession of
me?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Rumour didn’t say that anyone had got
possession of you, dear; it said that you had got possession of him.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Of whom?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I really couldn’t catch his name—they spoke of
him as “that poor fellow.”</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I don’t think that Captain Plunger stands in
need of their commiseration.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Captain Plunger! What, is Captain Plunger
married?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Captain Plunger is.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. And yet he had the impudence to make me think
he wasn’t?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Do you mean to say it’s Captain Plunger you’ve
been flirting with?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. For all the world as if he was a bachelor! the
wretch!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. The monster! But I’m even with him; for he
can’t have flirted half as hard with you as I have done with Mr. Larkspur.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Mr. Larkspur! Is it Mr. Larkspur you’ve been
flirting with?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Of course it is. He always was a favourite of
mine.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But you were not a favourite of his. He doesn’t
care for you a bit.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I fear, myself, it’s a good deal.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. It isn’t though, I tell you. He can’t bear the
sight of you.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I dare say not, my love. It will of course
remind him that I am another’s.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. But he doesn’t care whose you are.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Well, well, you needn’t get excited, dear. If
you <i>are</i> married, Mr. Larkspur’s state of mind is of no consequence to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. It’s just because I’m married that it is of
consequence to me—for I’m his wife.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. You Mr. Larkspur’s wife? Then Mr. Larkspur’s
married?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I should think he is.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I am so glad. It was so very painful to
suppose that he was dying for me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. If you have supposed so, you have given
yourself a great deal of superfluous anxiety. He was never better in his life.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I’m very glad to hear it. So he’s married you,
my dear? I was afraid, when he perceived I was inflexible, he would do something rash.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Do you mean to say that he’s proposed to
you?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I never let him go so far, my pet. But you
should see how he makes love to me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I will. I’ll hide behind the curtains here,
like this—(<i>retires among the curtains</i>) and listen with both ears.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Do, darling, and you’ll have a pleasant time
of it.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Re-enter </i>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>,<i> through
window, <span class="stage">L</span>.</i></p>

<p class="no_indent">You’ve come back, have you, Mr. Larkspur?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I have come back, Mrs. Plunger.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh! You’ve found out that, I’m married?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. And whom to. I must say that I think you might
have told me. I consider that flirtation by a married woman is most reprehensible.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I quite agree with you. I think it almost as
abominable as flirtation by a married man.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Eh?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. I congratulate you, Mr. Larkspur.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Then you’ve heard <i>I’m</i> married? Well I
am. I’m married to the nicest girl in England; but ten days at Dumpington are more than
flesh can stand. I got intolerably tired of its monotony, and for a little change I
thought I would make love to you.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. What, for a little change!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. No other reason I assure you. Fortunately,
Ethel thought she’d occupy the time in making love to<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-22">[Pg 22]</a></span> Captain Plunger. I didn’t like her making
love to him, and so I thought she mightn’t like my making love to you, and I’m not going
to do it any more. I further beg to state that Mrs. Larkspur is not on the look out for a
husband, that in my opinion she has not gone off at all, and that I don’t believe she ever
angled after anyone.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. (<i>running out</i>) You dear old darling,
you’re the greatest love that is or ever was or ever will be. I don’t care for anyone but
you. I only flirted to cure you. I beg your pardon, and I’ll never do so any more; and
you’ll forgive me, won’t you? (<i>on her knees</i>)</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Ethel, are you on the look-out for a
husband?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Edwin, did you never see a girl three times
without proposing to her?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Did you angle after Captain Plunger?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Did you say that if you’d thought I should
accept you, you should never have proposed to me?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I didn’t. You’ve been told a lot of wicked
stories. (<i>raising her</i>)</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. So have you.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. What a delightful reconciliation!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. Yes, it is delightful, Mrs. Plunger, to
discover in one’s wife a woman who’s as amiable after marriage as before.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh, Ethel always had the reputation of an
amiable woman. People said, when I was quite a child, she was an amiable woman.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. (<i>aside to</i> E<span
class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>) Never mind her, she doesn’t know that Captain Plunger
first proposed to me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. What, in his whiskers?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. And you rejected them?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. For you!</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. I’ve licked the whiskers! Bravo! “See the
conquering hero comes, sound the trumpets, beat the drums!” (<i>band strikes up again</i>)
Oh, no, don’t, please.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Re-enter </i>C<span class="smallerfont">APTAIN</span> P<span

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Here’s that dreadful band again. The leader says
the bagpipes have told everyone we’re pitching out<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span> half crowns, and all the music in the town is on its way
here.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Captain Plunger, I am given to understand that
you’ve been going on with Mrs. Larkspur in a most improper manner.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. Nothing of the sort, my love. I never flirt—when
you are with me.</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">DWIN</span>. If he has, you must forgive him this time, Mrs.
Plunger, as my wife’s forgiven me. (<i>band stops</i>)</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. What’s she forgiven you, Larkspur?</p>

<p>E<span class="smallerfont">THEL</span>. I’ve forgiven him his going on with Mrs.
Plunger.</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. So have I. I don’t at all resent his going on
with Mrs. Plunger.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. P. Oh, you monster!</p>

<p>C<span class="smallerfont">APT</span>. What I should resent would be his going off with
Mrs. Plunger.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
